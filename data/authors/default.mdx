I'm a versatile Software Developer and UI/UX Developer with a strong track record of bringing digital products to market. Over the years, [I have designed, developed, and launched dozens of high-performing websites](https://hyden.ca/works/) for clients across industries like health & wellness, travel, and food & beverage. My expertise in React, Next.js, and full-stack development allows me to create custom solutions that are both scalable and user-friendly. Whether it's building a custom CMS, integrating APIs like Stripe and PayPal, or optimizing user experiences with thoughtful UI/UX design, I focus on delivering results that help businesses grow.

Beyond development, I have played a key role in the business community, sharing my knowledge and insights as a speaker at [Central Ontario's premier business event](https://xceleratesummit.co/), the Xcelerate Learning Series. Was [contracted by the City of Barrie as the Web Development Lead](http://barrie.ca/) for their Digital Main Street and Going Digital initiatives, consulting with over 100 businesses to improve their digital presence. My work in these programs earned me a Certificate of Recognition from the Mayor of Barrie, highlighting my impact in helping businesses modernize their operations and marketing strategies.

Collaboration is at the core of my approach. I have worked closely with designers, photographers, and videographers to create cohesive brand experiences, ensuring that every project I take on is visually compelling and strategically effective. I also mentor, conduct code reviews, and stay ahead of industry trends to continuously refine my craft. With a passion for innovation and a results-driven mindset, I thrive on turning ideas into fully functional, market-ready products.
